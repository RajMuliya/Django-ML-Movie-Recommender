Trapped in a job that suffocates his creative spirit, Tom finds solace in clandestine moments stolen with his canvas, where his imagination runs wild and his soul finds refuge.

Yet, his sanctuary is shattered when a devastating breakup leaves him emotionally crippled, his heart a fractured canvas, splattered with the hues of despair. It is in this desolate landscape that Kavya, a ray of sunshine in the otherwise gray cubicle jungle, enters his life. Her effervescent spirit and boundless compassion breathe life into the dreary office corridors, her laughter a melody that dances through the air, dispelling the shadows that haunt Tom's heart.

As they toil side by side in the fluorescent-lit confines of their workplace, Kavya glimpses the hidden depths of Tom's soul, buried beneath the layers of corporate conformity. She sees beyond the facade of indifference, recognizing the raw talent that lies dormant within him, waiting to be unleashed upon the canvas. With unwavering faith and unwarranted optimism, she becomes his muse, urging him to reclaim his passion for painting and reignite the fire that once burned brightly within him.

Their bond blossoms amidst the chaos of deadlines and office politics, their friendship a beacon of hope in the sea of corporate cynicism. Together, they navigate the treacherous waters of love and ambition, finding solace in each other's company as they confront the demons that haunt their pasts and the uncertainties that loom on the horizon.

But just as Tom begins to find solace in the vibrant hues of his newfound passion and the warmth of Kavya's affection, a moral quandary threatens to unravel the fragile threads of their budding romance. Caught between the dictates of his conscience and the stirrings of his heart, Tom finds himself torn between duty and desire, his inner turmoil casting a shadow over their burgeoning relationship.

As the lines between right and wrong blur and the boundaries of their love are tested, Tom and Kavya must confront their deepest fears and insecurities, grappling with the complexities of loyalty, trust, and self-discovery. In the crucible of their shared experiences, they unearth hidden truths about themselves and each other, forging a bond that transcends the confines of their corporate existence.

""ME AND YOU"" is a poignant tale of healing and redemption, a testament to the transformative power of love and the resilience of the human spirit. Through the lens of Tom and Kavya's journey, we are reminded that true beauty lies not in the perfection of a flawless masterpiece, but in the imperfect strokes of a heart laid bare, painted with the colors of vulnerability, passion, and unfettered devotion.",Shreyansh Pratihar,"Shubh Soni, Aditi Singh, Pallavi Singh, Ajay Sharma, Gaurav Khetterpal"

The film shows a journey of a teenage girl raised in rural India by a progressive father who is extremely keen on educating her daughter to metric and beyond. The film begins with a rural Indian village situated 200kms away from Banaras where the people are yet to bring social acceptance for women education. But one man takes the initiative to not only send her daughter to school but he made sure education was an integral part of his daughter's life and he cultivated ambitions in her without bothering about the occasional social bashing that was happening every now and then. This effected our girl and she grew up to be confident and strong headed who would not fear to speak her voice out loud. Education brings out a certain dignity to a women's personality and we sketch that difference out loud in Geeta and other girls of her age in the same periphery. The story progresses as Geeta gets a generous marriage offer which seems quite appropriate for her but her father calls it off as Geeta shockingly fails her metric exams. He declares he wouldn't marry her daughter until she passes her 10th metric. And from here we set on a journey of struggle of woman against society, journey of a romance where our male protagonist 'Kundan' rises to the epitome of an ideal man that our society needs, journey of comedy of errors and how we overcome our setbacks in life with a big smile, strong determination and a tint of faith. The story progresses as we see a beautiful bond between Kundan and Geeta and the lengths taken by a boy to help his would be wife achieve her dreams. He not only takes a stand for her from the society but also from his mother. He himself being 8th pass, never considers the idea that his wife being more educated than her can be a matter of male ego. He depicts the man our society desperately needs today where man and woman aren't competitors rather should be working as allies for a better future. The parallel world portrayed is that of Indian education system and how it functions. The accessibility of better education and loopholes around it. The climax of the film is drawn from a real major scam where the top 10 students who excelled are called for re- examination. Will Geeta be able to overcome the family drama and fight the system?",Pradip Khairwar,"Kashika Kapoor, Anuj Saini, Atul Srivastava, Alka Amin, Pranay Dixit"

Amongst them resides a young man named Ganga, who enjoys playful activities with his friends, engages in song and drink, and offers assistance to everyone around. However, in this same village, a figure named Alluraiah, along with his son Deva, purchases the fish caught by the villagers at a low rate and sells it to the city at significantly higher prices.

Ganga, who rebels against this exploitative policy, argues that they should sell the fish themselves, leading to a growing enmity between them. Deva's wife, devising a plan to prevent the conflict from escalating further, arranges for Nandini, Deva's sister who resides abroad, to return. She emphasizes that they would all be losers if the feud with Ganga persists.

Meanwhile, a new teacher arrives in the village and transforms the dilapidated school. Despite the parents' reluctance to send their children to school, change comes about with Ganga's assistance. Ganga forms a fondness for this teacher. However, the story takes a turn when Ganga, in front of everyone, declares that he will marry Nandini for the sake of the village, rather than the teacher.

Just then, a significant antagonist named ""Gajini Mohammad"" arrives at the Vetapalem sea upon learning that a migration of tuna fish worth lakhs is occurring. The entire town is unable to resist him alone. He and his followers perpetrate violence, leading to the deaths of many villagers.

3135,tt33320857,Shalivahana Shake,2024.0,unknown,"Time is an illusion said Einstein, well what if we could manipulate that illusion. The story opens by contextualizing the audience with the creation of a motif that goes on to play a pivotal role in the story. This is achieved through an old lady narrating a tale to her granddaughter. The narrative of the tale being that a vendor from Satya Yuga (reference to Hindu mythology) manages to persuade Brahma (the four headed god, ascribed to the creation of the world) to create a time turner, so as to correct a wrongdoing of his past. Brahma obliges, and creates a time turner in the form of a conch shell. Having successfully corrected his past mistake, the vendor returns to Brahmaloka, to express his gratitude to Brahma in person. That is when Brahma educates him about the difference in the passage of time between earth and Brahmaloka, i.e., One day Brahmaloka is equivalent to the passage of all the four yugas (namely Satya Yuga, Tretha Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and Kali Yuga) on earth. Having realized this and remembering the horrendous mistake of leaving the conch shell (time turner) on earth, he rushes back with lightning speed in a quest to find it, but with no luck, returns empty handed. It is at this point that the old lady ends the tale. The main story then meanders into a village setting, highlighting a group of four young men- Ranga, Suri, Daya and Pandya, each unlike the other, yet glued together by their shared love for kabaddi and swimming. ""All that happens, happens for the good"" is one idiom that holds good for what follows next. Swimming at the dam before committing to a heavy practice session of kabaddi was something that the four lads followed ritualistically, however, this time around, their plans get tweaked, for they receive information that there happens to be a crack at the dam, making it unsafe for swimming, which thereby compels them to take a dip at the nearby well. Call it an act of deliberation or call it an act of fate because, it so happens that the conch shell (time turner) finds its way into the hands of Ranga, the grandson of the little girl who was listening that old lady's tale. No sooner does he find it, than Pandya dives from an astronomical height and drowns. Panic sets in. With a dead friend, a tournament to win and strange looking conch shell, the story revolves around the lives and deaths of these four gentlemen and the time turner. It should come as no surprise to us that as the story progresses, Ranga figures out the working of that time turner compelled by his circumstances and curiosity. However, the flip side to turning time unravels itself throughout the course of the story in interestingly morbid ways. With every usage of the time turner, the stakes of risk keep getting higher, and the death of a person becomes inevitable. After numerous trials of turning time in an attempt to keep his companions and fellow villagers alive, Ranga evokes the innate human tendencies of greed and dissatisfaction, by choosing to turn time yet again. This time around, instead of yielding the result that he had expected, it takes him to a landscape of a ginormous tree on the banks of a lake filled with lotus flowers, inhabited by a young boy with four heads holding a lotus flower in his hand. The very landscape and scenario that he had been dreaming of for all these days. If anything, it wasn't a mere act of coincidence. Afterall, as Freud would put it, dreams are pathways to our unconscious. What follows next, is up to the interpretation and amusement of the audience. Afterall, bending time comes with its repercussions, right?!",Girish G.,"Shylesh Kumar M.M, Prashanth Y.N., Girish G., Supritha Narayan, Dayanand Sagar"

Every year after graduation, lakhs of students from all corners of Maharashtra come to Pune to prepare for competitive examinations. The main reason behind this is that they do not get a job after getting a degree, but most of the students feel that they should get a government job. Students listen to the speech of an officer who has reached a high position through competitive examinations and get inspired by that speech and prepare for competitive examinations. Students begin to recognize the power, honor, and money that come after becoming an officer. Students dream of bringing a red beacon car to their doorstep.

Since the importance of a government job is still unique in an ordinary middle-class family, the parents of the students are also willing to give the students as much time as they need to prepare for competitive exams. But competition is a tricky thing. Lakhs of students come every year to prepare for competitive exams, but no one sees how many of them pass and exit.

 The pass percentage of students is less than 1%. This means that 99.99 per cent of students fail the competitive exam every year. But still these students continue to study competitive exams for years without leaving the study of competitive exams. So if you look at it, you will notice that a student spends about eight to ten years studying for competitive exams. But even after spending so much time preparing for these exams, if these students couldn't get a job then what should those students do? The film tries to answer this question. The film teaches us to look at competitive exams only as exams and not make a life out of them.

 Every actor in the film is a student preparing for competitive exams. The students who have experienced the reality of competitive exams have dared to present that reality to the society through the film. This is a movie that every student should see.

 The hero of the film has come to Pune from his village to prepare for the competitive examination. The condition of the hero's house is very bad. The hero's mother sends the hero's monthly expenses by working in someone else's farm. Naik is also preparing for competitive exams with all his dreams. But even after all this, does the hero really succeed in the competitive exam? How does he deal with the challenges? What kind of support the hero gets from the hero's friends in all this time, we get to see in this film.",Avinash Shembatwad,"Ajit Abhyankar, Jivan Aghav, Sunil Godabole, Pratik Lande, Nileshkumar"

Equipped with the power of language and the newfound access it has enabled her, Charu is trying to push the limits that the hearing world has imposed on her and is actively working towards building a larger community of independent, empowered Deaf women in India. Through her feminist forum called, ""Deaf Women Too"", she aims to reshape societal perspectives and create a more inclusive future.

Surbhi, on the other hand has been an interpreter all her life, bridging the communication gap between the Deaf and hearing worlds. While continuing to fulfill her role as an interpreter, she is now learning to break out of the weight that comes with being a caregiver and is finding what it means to do something for herself.

By opening up this conversation about the need to express beyond just the Deaf community, 'If I could Tell You' embarks upon a broader inquiry into the significance of language in our shared human experience. Interspersed with performances and interviews with a dancer, a drag queen, an actor and an ISL poet, the film explores how these various manifestations of visual language help us understand agency, autonomy and care.

This documentary pushes the boundaries of storytelling by blending diverse media forms, including animation and artistic performances. It is also the first instance of an Indian film featuring an original ISL poem by a Deaf poet.",Niharika Popli,unknown

Abram's path begins with a stark declaration: dragging a coffin through the streets, he proclaims, ""I have killed God!"" This attracts Fitna. His alarm brings media hounds and police, transforming a quiet day into a whirlwind. As chaos unfolds, Abram's past unfolds too. College students hack into his laptop, projecting his private discussions onto a live news channel. This unexpected audience witnesses philosophical debates about existentialism, nihilism, and the very origins of the concept of God. Beyond intellectual discourse, the film delves into humanity's darker side. The conversation shifts to the manipulative use of God's name to justify violence and discrimination based on color, creed, caste, and gender. Abram's act ignites a firestorm. He becomes a symbol, interpreted differently by various factions. Some see him as a Bad Guy, others as a liberator challenging oppressive doctrines. The narrative deftly weaves Abram's philosophical debates with the escalating external conflict. The film builds suspense, leaving the audience to wonder - what is Abram's true motive? Has he truly killed God, or is he a man desperate to awaken the world? ""God Must Die"" is more than just philosophical musings. It's a social commentary, urging viewers to confront the complex realities of faith, prejudice, and the search for meaning in a seemingly godless world. By the time the police raid Abram's home, he has vanished. His absence becomes a powerful statement, leaving the audience with lingering questions and no easy answers. Did he escape?

3818,tt30781222,Maya-The Truth,2024.0,"Drama, Romance","""Maya-the Truth"" appears to be a compelling and thought-provoking film, delving into the themes of morality, consequences, and the human psyche. The story's focus on the protagonist's journey through his own past misdeeds and the eventual reckoning is a classic narrative about the inevitability of facing the consequences of one's actions. The film's exploration of the idea that ""the past can become the truth of tomorrow"" is particularly intriguing. This suggests a deeper commentary on how our actions, especially those we might want to forget or dismiss, have a way of defining our future. The character of Maya seems to be a catalyst for this revelation, forcing the protagonist, Arjun, to confront the truths he has long evaded. The performances, as described, seem to be particularly noteworthy. Mahi Zaal's portrayal of Maya is highlighted as a standout, suggesting a nuanced and powerful performance. Fahad Asad as Raj and Naina Gill as Khushbu, despite the latter's brief role, also appear to have delivered impactful performances. Director Naha Laj and writer Naeem Tahir seem to have created a film that's not just entertainment but also a medium for delivering a powerful message. The emphasis on the 'sensual animal inside man' and the disregard for the 'sanctity of relationships' points to a critical examination of human behaviour and societal norms.",Neha Laaj,"Fahad Asad, Naina Gill, Mahi Zaal"

The tendrils of addiction have ensnared the youth, turning them into perpetrators of heinous crimes, shattering lives and tearing apart the fabric of society.

Having suffered the devastating consequences firsthand, Bhargav Ram emerges from the ashes of his own tragedy with a resolve as unyielding as steel. Determined to stem the tide of destruction, he embarks on a solitary crusade to reclaim the souls lost to the clutches of addiction.

Armed not with weapons, but with unwavering conviction and an indomitable spirit, Bhargav Ram becomes a beacon of hope in a city drowning in despair. He delves into the heart of darkness, confronting the kingpins of the narcotics trade and dismantling their empires brick by brick.

Yet, his journey is fraught with peril, as he navigates through a labyrinth of deceit and betrayal. He faces adversaries who stop at nothing to protect their illicit interests, confronting him with challenges that seem insurmountable.

But Bhargav Ram is undeterred, drawing strength from the memories of those he has lost and the vision of a brighter future for the youth ensnared by addiction.
